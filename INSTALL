Installing Quilt
================

Dependencies
------------

Quilt is written in Ruby using the Ruby FuseFS library.
So all you need is Ruby itself, the Rubygems package manager and the ruby fusefs library.
On Debian derivates you can achieve that using the following command:

  apt-get install ruby rubygems libfusefs-ruby


Installation
------------

As soon I released this as a gem, you will be able to install via Rubygems:

  gem install quilt


Problems
--------

On Ubuntu the fuse install lack adequate permission settings:

  fusermount: failed to open /etc/fuse.conf: Permission denied


The following line can be used to fix this:

  chmod a+rwx /etc/fuse.conf
